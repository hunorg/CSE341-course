{- More combining functions

   â€¢ What if you want to curry a tupled function or vice-versa?
   â€¢ What if a function's arguments are in the wrong order for the
     partial appplication you want?

   Naturally, it is easy to write higher-order wrapper functions
     - And their types are neat logical formulas
