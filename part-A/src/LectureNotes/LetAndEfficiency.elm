{- Avoiding repeated recursion with `let`

   - Recursive functions should avoid computing the same result more than once
   - In ML-like languages, repeated recursive calls can cause exponential slowdown
   - Example: `badMax` calls itself twice on the same sublist â€” slow in ML
   - In Elm, this isn't exponential (evaluation is eager), but still inefficient

   - Solution: use a `let` binding to remember the recursive result
       - Avoids redundant computation
       - Leads to better style and performance

   - This pattern is a common and important use of `let` expressions
