; unlike ML, Racket really has assignment statements
    ; but used only-when-really-appopiate!

; (set! x e) set-bang

; for the x in the current inverionment, subsequent lookups of x get the result
; of evaluating expression e
    ; any code using this x will be affected 
    ; like x = e in Java, C, Python, etc.

; once you have side-effects, sequences are useful 
; (begin e1 e2 ... en)

; example uses set! at top-level; mutation local variables is similar

(define b 3)
(define f (lambda (x) (* 1 (+ x b))))
(define c (+ b 4)) ; 7
(set! b 5)
(define z (f 4)) ; 9
(define w c) ; 7

; not much new here: 
    ; environment for closure determined when function is defined,
    ; but body is evaluated when function is called 
; once an expression produces a value, it is irrevelant how the value was produced 

;mutating top-level definitions is particularly problematic
    ; what if any code could do set! on anything?
    ; how could we defend against this?

; a general principle: if something you need not to change might
; change, make a local copy of it - example:

; (define f 
    ; (let ([b b])
        ; (lambda (x) (* 1 (+ x b)))))

; simple elegant languages design:
    ; primitives like + and * are just predefined variables bound to functions
    ; but maybe that means they are mutable
    ; example continued:
; (define f 
    ; (let ([b b]
          ; [+ +]
          ; [* *]
        ; (lambda (x) (* 1 (+ x b))))))

; even that don't work if f uses other functions that use things
; that might get mutated - all functions would need to copy
; everyting mutable they used

; in racket, you do not have to program like this 
    ; each file is a modile 
    ; if a module does not use set! on a top-level variable, then 
    ; Racket makes it constant and forbids set! outside the module 
    ; primitives like +, *, and cons are in a module that does not
    ; mutate them 

; Showed you this for the concept of copying to defend against mutation
    ; easier defense: Do not allow mutation 
    ; mutable top-level bindings a highly dubious idea
