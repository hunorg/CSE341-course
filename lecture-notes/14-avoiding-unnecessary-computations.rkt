; thunks let you skip expensive computations if they are not needed 
; great if you take the true-branch:

    ; (define (f th)
        ; (if (..) 0 (... (th) ...)))

; but worse if you end up using the thunk more than once: 

    ; (define (f th)
        ; (... (if (...) 0 (... (th) ...))
            ; (if (...) 0 (... (th) ...))
            ; ...
            ; (if (...) 0 (... (th) ...))))
; this is a silly addition function that purposely runs slows for
; demonstration purposes 

(define (slow-add x y)
    (letrec ([slow-id (lambda (y z)
                        (if (= 0 z)
                        y
                        (slow-id (- z 1))))])
        (+ (slow-id x 50000000) y)))

; multiplies x and result of y-thunk, calling y-thunk x times

(define (my-mult x y-thunk) ; assumes x is >= 0 
    (cond [(= x 0) 0]
          [(= x 1) (y-thunk)]
          [#t (+ (y-thunk) (my-mult (- x 1) y-thunk))]))

; Best of both worlds 

; assuming some expensive computation has no side effects, ideally 
; we would: 
    ; not compute until needed
    ; remember the answer so future uses complete immediately 
; called lazy evaluation 

; languages wheremostconstructs, including function arguments, 
; work this way are lazy languages 
    ; Haskell

; Racket predefines support for promises, but we can make our own 
    ; thunks and mutable pairs are enough
