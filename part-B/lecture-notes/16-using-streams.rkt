; Streams 

; a stream is an infinite sequence of values 
    ; so cannot make a stream by making all the values
    ; key idea: use a thunk to delay creating most of the sequence 
    ; just a programming idiom 

; a powerful concept for division of labor:
    ; stream producer knows how create any number of values 
    ; stream consumer decides how many values to ask for 

; someexamples of stream you might (not) be familiar with:
    ; user actions (mouse clicks, etc.)
    ; UNIX pipes: cmd1 | cmd2 has cmd2 "pull" data from cmd1
    ; output values from a sequential feedback circuit 

; Using streams 

; we will represent streams using pairs and thunks 
; let a stream be a thunk that when called returns a pair:
    ; '(next-answer . next-thunk)

; so given a stream st, the client can get any number of elements 
    ; first: (car (s))
    ; second (car ((cdr (s))))
    ; third: (car ((cdr ((cdr (s)))))
    ; (usually bind (cdr (s)) to a variable or pass to a recursive
    ; function)
